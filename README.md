# college_grad_major_vis

Took data of the different major college graduates and explored relationships such as: 
Do students in more popular majors make more money? 
How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female? 
Which category of majors have the most students? 

Used different sets of data visualizations to explore these relationships and column distributions
